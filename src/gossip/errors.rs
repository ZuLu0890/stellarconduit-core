//! Typed error hierarchy for the gossip subsystem.
//!
//! Prior to this module, gossip-layer failures were represented as raw
//! `String`s or by overloading `Result<(), PeerIdentity>` to signal a banned
//! peer. `GossipError` replaces those ad-hoc conventions with a single,
//! structured error type that callers can match on and that can grow to
//! describe future failure modes (queue overflow, codec errors, …) without
//! breaking the API.
